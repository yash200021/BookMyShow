# BookMyShow
I am coding BookMyShow MVP version end-to-end, using MySQL for data Persistence.

Note :- if we are creating Mapping class for two classes like XY, where individual classes X and Y are attributes of XY, then
Cardinality between mapping class and Individual class will always be many to one.

XY  --> X (Many to One)
XY  --> Y (Many to One)
